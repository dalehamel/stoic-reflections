<p>This document will hopefully not make me appear to think I am an expert in philosophy or Stoicism.</p>
<p>I am neither.</p>
<p>What I’ve written here are my reflections, struggles, and ideas on Stoicism. My primary intention is to curate and organize my thoughts, and reference the works of wiser men than I. If you the reader happen to find this useful, then that is all the better.</p>

<p>I try to think about all of the worst case scenarios for anything that gives me anxiety. I tend to do this as I feel anxiety, but also ahead of time.</p>
<h2 id="memento-mori">2 - Memento mori</h2>
<p>“Let death […] be daily before your eyes”.</p>
<p>The full quote comes to us from Epictetus:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode email"><code class="sourceCode email"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1">                                  XXI</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3">Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" title="4">before your eyes, but death chiefly; and you will never entertain an</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" title="5">abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.</a></code></pre></div>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="enchiridion-gutenberg">[<a href="#ref-enchiridion-gutenberg" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>I remind myself that I might die today, or tomorrow. That I have no idea how long I could live and that I should be grateful to have another day at my disposal.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode email"><code class="sourceCode email"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1">16. But now, to close my letter, I have only to stamp the usual seal upon it, in</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" title="2">other words, to commit thereto some noble message to be delivered to you: &quot;The</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" title="3">fool, with all his other faults, has this also, – he is always getting ready to</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" title="4">live.&quot;[3] Reflect, my esteemed Lucilius, what this saying means, and you will</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" title="5">see how revolting is the fickleness of men who lay down every day new</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-6" title="6">foundations of life, and begin to build up fresh hopes even at the brink of the</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-7" title="7">grave.</a></code></pre></div>
<p>From the Gummere translation of Seneca’s Epistulae morales ad Lucilium <span class="citation" data-cites="letters-to-lucilius">[<a href="#ref-letters-to-lucilius" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>, Book 2, Letter 13, Verse 16.</p>
<p>The original latin <span class="citation" data-cites="letters-to-lucilius-latin">[<a href="#ref-letters-to-lucilius-latin" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> for this appears to be:</p>
<pre><code>Sed iam finem epistulae faciam, si illi signum suum in pressero, id est aliquam
magnificam vocem perferendam ad te mandavero. &#39;Inter cetera mala hoc quoque
habet stultitia: semper incipit vivere.&#39; Considera quid vox ista significet,
Lucili virorum optime, et intelleges quam foeda sit hominum levitas cotidie
nova vitae fundamenta ponentium, novas spes etiam in exitu inchoantium.</code></pre>
<h2 id="step-outside-yourself">3 - Step outside yourself</h2>
<p>I try to view myself from a distance, or imagine that I am seeing myself as a stranger would.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode email"><code class="sourceCode email"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" title="1">                                  XXVI</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-3" title="3">The will of nature may be learned from things upon which we are all</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-4" title="4">agreed. As when our neighbor’s boy has broken a cup, or the like, we are</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-5" title="5">ready at once to say, “These are casualties that will happen”; be</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-6" title="6">assured, then, that when your own cup is likewise broken, you ought to be</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-7" title="7">affected just as when another’s cup was broken. Now apply this to greater</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-8" title="8">things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-9" title="9">not say, “This is an accident of mortality.” But if anyone’s own child</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-10" title="10">happens to die, it is immediately, “Alas! how wretched am I!” It should</a>

<p>I literally try to imagine myself from outside of myself, and remind myself of my small significance in relation to vastness of the cosmos, and the short scale of time of any human life. This helps me to not take everyday things for granted.</p>
<p>The other technique, to try and see myself and my own circumstances as a stranger would is probably closer to Epictetus’ original advice from the Enchiridion.</p>
<p>In particular, when I catch myself bewailing something trivial, I like to myself hearing Epictetus jokingly chide me “AlAs! HoW WreTchED Am I!” at my imagined hardships.</p>
<p>Another quote that I particularly like is from the discourses of Epictetus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What, then, must my leg be lame?” And is it for one paltry leg, wretch, that you accuse the universe?</p>

<p>From the Enchiridion <span class="citation" data-cites="enchiridion-gutenberg">[<a href="#ref-enchiridion-gutenberg" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>, #46:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode email"><code class="sourceCode email"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" title="1">                                  XLVI</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-3" title="3">Never proclaim yourself a philosopher, nor make much talk among the</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-4" title="4">ignorant about your principles, but show them by actions. Thus, at an</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-5" title="5">entertainment, do not discourse how people ought to eat, but eat as you</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-6" title="6">ought. For remember that thus Socrates also universally avoided all</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-7" title="7">ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be introduced by</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-8" title="8">him to philosophers, he took them and introduced them; so well did he</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-9" title="9">bear being overlooked. So if ever there should be among the ignorant any</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-10" title="10">discussion of principles, be for the most part silent. For there is great</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-11" title="11">danger in hastily throwing out what is undigested. And if anyone tells</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-12" title="12">you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may be</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-13" title="13">sure that you have really entered on your work. For sheep do not hastily</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-14" title="14">throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten, but,</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-15" title="15">inwardly digesting their food, they produce it outwardly in wool and</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-16" title="16">milk. Thus, therefore, do you not make an exhibition before the ignorant</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-17" title="17">of your principles, but of the actions to which their digestion gives</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-18" title="18">rise.</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This also really reminds me of #22, which I quoted earlier at the very start of this. Another reason why I’m hesitant to write this at all - this lesson that it is better to show your intention through action.</p>
<p>Rather than vomit up the grass to show what good sheep they have been, or in my case, vomit up whatever philosophical teachings / lessons that are in fashion, it is better to actually try and <strong>live</strong> these actions to show their merit, and indeed speak nothing of them.</p>
<p>So, as much as I write here, I must always keep in mind that if I am not actually living these lessons, I am just like the sheep as I vomit up the lessons, rather than produce the “wool” of their teachings outwardly.</p>
<p>I think that this teaching also helps to be skeptical of others who preach, but do not even practice what they preach. It also adds helps to remain skeptical of anyone preaching anything in general - if they really wanted to convince the stoic, they should simply live as they would preach others to do so.</p>
<p>I think that Diogenes <span class="citation" data-cites="diogenes-of-sinope">[<a href="#ref-diogenes-of-sinope" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>, an early Cynic that probably helped to influence Stoic philosophy even before it was yet to form, is an interesting example to analyze for this.</p>
<p>He did appear to truly live the ascetic lifestyle that he professed to, but he also was very bold and eager to point the finger at others who he felt were less virtuous. There are even accounts of him bursting into houses uninvited to tell others how they were living wrong, slaves to their possessions, and other Cynic doctrine.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be like Diogenes (though I do admire his persistence), so to the greatest extent that I can I will avoid having a “supercilious look”, and keep to my own affairs, unless someone asks me about my Philosophical thinking and struggles.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-within-my-power">Is it within my power?</h2>
<p>Excerpt from the Enchiridion <span class="citation" data-cites="enchiridion-gutenberg">[<a href="#ref-enchiridion-gutenberg" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>, #1:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode email"><code class="sourceCode email"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" title="1">                                   I</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-4" title="4">are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire,</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-6" title="6">power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-7" title="7">are not properly our own affairs.</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This is probably the most famous, and “number one hit” of the Enchiridion. Many know it as the “Serenity prayer”, and as I learned in <span class="citation" data-cites="goodreads-how-to-be-a-stoic">[<a href="#ref-goodreads-how-to-be-a-stoic" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span> many other cultures have had similar sentiments expressed throughout history.</p>
<p>As stated here, I think that this is a very helpful framework. Like others though, I think that the idea could use a bit of an update. I don’t believe that it’s a perfectly clean dichotomy - I think that the “Trichotomy Of Choice” <span class="citation" data-cites="goodreads-a-guide-to-the-good-life">[<a href="#ref-goodreads-a-guide-to-the-good-life" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span> that William Irvine discusses gets it right. There is an important third distinction: things which we have some, but not complete, control over.</p>
<p>A cannot influnce if I get a promotion, that <strong>is</strong> truly outside of my control. That doesn’t mean that I should not work hard, that I should not do everything within my power to <strong>deserve</strong> a promotion. Thus, I should set my goal on doing the best work I can, and enjoying it. This is just an example of course, but I think is good advice in general. By setting the goal to something that is actually within my power - doing my best work, I cannot be disappointed if something that is external to my power - getting a promotion, doesn’t manifest.</p>
<p>I feel the same is true of romantic relationships. When I have most been rejected in the past, it was because I had set as a goal to win someone over. I was so concetrated on trying to be the best person that I thought they wanted me to be, I didn’t actually concentrate on being the best <strong>me</strong> that I could be. Once I did that, rejection was less painful and I was more willing to take another swing at things. I couldn’t affect if I was rejected or not, I could only do my best, try to roll with the punches, and be better for next time.</p>

<h1 id="modern-sources">Modern Sources</h1>
<p>These are much easier to digest, as the authors are very smart and have done a lot of work to simplify and adequately contextualize the spirit of the original documents.</p>
<p>I went with these summaries first, and then to the original sources as I found that having a few seasoned guides to help me along made a big difference.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-be-a-stoic">How to be a Stoic</h2>
<p>This book <span class="citation" data-cites="goodreads-how-to-be-a-stoic">[<a href="#ref-goodreads-how-to-be-a-stoic" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span> by Philosophy Professor Massimo Pigliucci <span class="citation" data-cites="how-to-be-a-stoic-homepage">[<a href="#ref-how-to-be-a-stoic-homepage" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span> was one of the most influential in my own journey towards Stoicism.</p>
<p>The book focuses mostly on Epictetus, and a modern interpretation of stoicism.</p>
<p>In particular, the idea that it’s actually quite alright to disagree with the few examples of Stoics we have in history, and proved a more modern interpretation of this philosophy, or rather, a practical use of this ancient wisdom in modern times.</p>
<p>This book ends recommending the reader next progress to the Enchiridion, and I highly recommend doing so. It is easy to find <span class="citation" data-cites="enchiridion-gutenberg">[<a href="#ref-enchiridion-gutenberg" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>, and the translations are easily interpreted and almost pithy. You can easily read it in its entirety in an hour, and you’ll recognize <strong>a lot</strong> of what Massimo is framing for you is directly from the source material.</p>
<p>I definitely recomend this above all else as a first read on Stoicism.</p>

<h1 id="original-sources">Original Sources</h1>
<p>While there are a number of great books that provide modern interpretations of ancient Stoic philosophy, I felt the need to read these original sources myself to better understand the nature of Stoicism.</p>
<h2 id="epictetus">Epictetus</h2>
<p>Epictetus simply means “Gained” or “Acquired”, as Epictetus was a (freed) slave. He may have had a name, but if he did it was lost to history.</p>
<p>We don’t have any of his actual writings either, but we do have the writing of one of his studenst, Arrian of Nicomedia, who is generally considered a pretty reptable source, and who tried to preserve the fidelity of the original teachings of Epictetus.</p>
<p>Epictetus was a student of Musonius Rufus <span class="citation" data-cites="musonius-rufus">[<a href="#ref-musonius-rufus" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>, and so much of Epictetus’ Stoic Philosophy was likely influenced by and built upon these teachings.</p>
<h3 id="the-enchiridion">The Enchiridion</h3>
<p>The Enchiridion is Arrian’s compilation of Epictetus “best hits”, and a pretty concise distillation of a lot of the material that is covered in the rest of the discourses.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="enchiridion-gutenberg">[<a href="#ref-enchiridion-gutenberg" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span></p>
<h3 id="discourses">Discourses</h3>
<p>There were supposedly 8 volumes of the discoruses, but 4 have been lost to time. This is a real shame, but what remains is very insightful. Much of this is greater detail of lessons from the Enchiridion, and a more conversational approach to philosophical discussion and lessons.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="epictetus-discourses">[<a href="#ref-epictetus-discourses" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span> from <span class="citation" data-cites="discourses-epictetus-source">[<a href="#ref-discourses-epictetus-source" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span></p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="musonius-rufus">[<a href="#ref-musonius-rufus" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span></p>
<h2 id="seneca">Seneca</h2>
<p>Seneca has a series of letters that I’v purchased the audiobook for, but have not yet listened to.</p>
<h2 id="marcus-aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</h2>
<p>These <span class="citation" data-cites="meditations-gutenberg">[<a href="#ref-meditations-gutenberg" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> are the reflections that the Roman Emperor, considered by many historians to be “the last good Emperor” of Rome. He wrote these to himself, titled: “Ta eis heauton”, literally meaning “things to one’s self”. It was discovered after his death, and published most commonly as just “Meditations”.</p>
<p>I had originally tried to start directly with the Meditations <span class="citation" data-cites="meditations-gutenberg">[<a href="#ref-meditations-gutenberg" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> by Marcus Aurelius, but felt that even with my interest in Ancient Rome, I still had a hard time easily understanding it without more context. I found that Epitetus’ Enchiridion was a much better starting point, as it was written to be an actual handbook, but I imagine that reading Marcus Aurelious will be quite insightful, as he is often held up as a, if not the, iconic Stoic.</p>
<p>I haven’t actually gotten through this yet, but I’ve heard it referenced quite extensively in <span class="citation" data-cites="goodreads-a-guide-to-the-good-life">[<a href="#ref-goodreads-a-guide-to-the-good-life" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. I believe that <span class="citation" data-cites="goodreads-the-obstacle-is-the-way">[<a href="#ref-goodreads-the-obstacle-is-the-way" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span> is meant to be a modern distillation of this, but until I’ve read the original I can’t meaningfully comment on to what fidelity it is presented with.</p>
<h1 id="why-stoicism">Why Stoicism</h1>
<p>On reflection, some of the aspects of Stoicism where things I had come upon on my own. For instance, I already practiced reflection of the day’s events, and negative visualization. Stoic teachings have helped me to provide more structure, intention, and reasoning to these existing habits, and allow me to exert more control over them, and not the opposite way around.</p>
<p>In other aspects, I found the advice to be things I intuitively agreed with, but had not yet come upon or internalized. These are where I must expend the most effort and intention, as I am more at odds with my nature here in some cases. For instance, I must daily remind myself to only dwell on those things which are within my control, and remind myself how best to assess this.</p>
<p>It could be that Stoicism is just a phase for me, a step towards something else - this has certainly been the pattern in my life. I am hopeful that I’ll be able to stick with this, as it feels to just “fit” in certain ways that other ways of living that I’ve tried. Up until now, this has mostly been a combination of improvising and (sometimes-) enlightened hedonism.</p>
<h1 id="my-path-to-stoicism">My path to Stoicism</h1>
<p>// FIXME probably cut this out to separate doc, it is self involved and // rambling, anyone interested can find it on their own.</p>
<p>This is my own story, as best as I can reason and as much as I’m willing to share. Perhaps you will have some parallels, perhaps you won’t. Either way, I hope that sharing how I arrived on it may help you in some way. I have put this bit last, as I feel it is longer and more difficult - by its very nature - to not degrade to something utterly self-involved. Any readers who have yet to make it this far will be spared at least, and this gives me some measure of comfort.</p>
<h2 id="studying-history">Studying History</h2>
<p>Gaius Marius was a character that struck me as inspiring and I leader that I wanted to emulate. When listening to Dan Carlin’s Death Throws of the Republic, edition of his Hardcore History podcast, he spoke of him in a way that I found really held him up as an admirable leader.</p>
<p>What I respected about Gaius Marius was that he would get down on the level of his “Marius Mules” as they were nicknamed, as they would all march in full gear to train and harden themselves, but because he would do it also they were motivated to do so. He lead by example. He did not dine in a special fancy tent with the officers, but with the men of his army, eating what they ate.</p>
<p>I intuited that Gaius Marius had Stoic qualities, just by other examples of people that I had known to behave “Stoically”. I don’t know much about his own connection to stoicism however, but he has inspired me all the same. Unfortunately I didn’t actually have much material to draw on other than a few historical anecdotes about him. As I kept listening to the podcast, I kept an eye out for other leadership icons, and other lessons to be learned.</p>
<p>I found other models throughout history, both through the podcast and the historical parables in many of Robert Greene’s books. This included both those whom I did and explicitly did <strong>not</strong> want to emulate. I found this model of analyzing stories (which is the common narrative approach Robert Greene uses throughout a lot of his books) to work pretty well for me. Having a story to illustrate a lesson is a helpful mnemonic trick, and have noticed that a lot of authors use it in some way to get their point across.</p>
<p>With this collection of stories though, I had to interpret and decide when to apply them, while trying to keep their essence in mind. This is a lot to juggle, and makes for a pretty complex framework. It’s not always clear when the lesson of a story applies well, or if I even interpreted the story properly.</p>
<p>What was lacking, I think, in this approach was structure. Narrative ideas are great for illustrating details, but I really wanted a framework, a core set of simple rules, to call back to. I feel these stories now help to weave together the details and provide color, where the framework of stoic philosophy serves as the structure that ties it together.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to keep in mind Robert Greene’s laws on… whatever, I find Epictetus gives a much more concise and refactored rules of living, but the parables apply to these just as well with a little interpretation.</p>
