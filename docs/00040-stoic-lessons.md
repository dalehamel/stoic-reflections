# Lessons

## Speak through action

From the Enchiridion, #46:

This also really reminds me of #22, which I quoted earlier at the very start of
this. Another reason why I'm hesitant to write this at all - this lesson that
it is better to show your intention through action.

Rather than vomit up the grass to show what good sheep they have been, or in my
case, vomit up whatever philosophical teachings / lessons that are in fashion,
it is better to actually try and **live** these actions to show their merit,
and indeed speak nothing of them.

So, as much as I write here, I must always keep in mind that if I am not
actually living these lessons, I am just like the sheep as I vomit up the
lessons, rather than produce the "wool" of their teachings outwardly.

I think that this teaching also helps to be skeptical of others who preach, but
do not even practice what they preach. It also adds helps to remain skeptical
of anyone preaching anything in general - if they really wanted to convince the
stoic, they should simply live as they would preach others to do so.

I think that Diogenes [@diogenes-of-sinope], an early Cynic that probably helped
to influence Stoic philosophy even before it was yet to form, is an interesting
example to analyze for this.

He did appear to truly live the ascetic lifestyle that he professed to, but he
also was very bold and eager to point the finger at others who he felt were
less virtuous. There are even accounts of him bursting into houses uninvited to
tell others how they were living wrong, slaves to their possessions, and other
Cynic doctrine.

I don't want to be like Diogenes (though I do admire his persistence), so to
the greatest extent that I can I will avoid having a "supercilious look", and
keep to my own affairs, unless someone asks me about my Philosophical thinking
and struggles.
