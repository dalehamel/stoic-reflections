Epictetus, Enchiridion #22 [@enchiridion-gutenberg]

This document will hopefully not make me appear to think I am an expert in
philosophy or Stoicism.

I am neither.

What I've written here are my reflections, struggles, and ideas on Stoicism. My
primary intention is to curate and organize my thoughts, and reference the
works of wiser men than I. If you the reader happen to find this useful, then
that is all the better.
