# Modern Sources

These are much easier to digest, as the authors are very smart and have done
a lot of work to simplify and adequately contextualize the spirit of the
original documents.

I went with these summaries first, and then to the original sources as I found
that having a few seasoned guides to help me along made a big difference.

## How to be a Stoic

This book [@goodreads-how-to-be-a-stoic] by Philosophy Professor Massimo Pigliucci
[@how-to-be-a-stoic-homepage] was one of the most influential in my own journey
towards Stoicism.

The book focuses mostly on Epictetus, and a modern interpretation of stoicism.

In particular, the idea that it's actually quite alright to disagree with the
few examples of Stoics we have in history, and proved a more modern
interpretation of this philosophy, or rather, a practical use of this ancient
wisdom in modern times.

This book ends recommending the reader next progress to the Enchiridion, and I
highly recommend doing so. It is easy to find [@enchiridion-gutenberg], and
the translations are easily interpreted and almost pithy. You can easily read
it in its entirety in an hour, and you'll recognize **a lot** of what Massimo
is framing for you is directly from the source material.

I definitely recomend this above all else as a first read on Stoicism.
