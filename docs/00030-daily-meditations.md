# My current daily meditations

## 1 - Premeditatio malorum

Negative Visualization.

I try to think about all of the worst case scenarios for anything that gives
me anxiety. I tend to do this as I feel anxiety, but also ahead of time.

## 2 - Memento mori

"Let death [...] be daily before your eyes".

The full quote comes to us from Epictetus:

```{.email include=src/enchiridion/enchiridion.txt startLine=667 endLine=671}
```
[@enchiridion-gutenberg]

I remind myself that I might die today, or tomorrow. That I have no idea how
long I could live and that I should be grateful to have another day at my
disposal.

```

From the Gummere translation of Seneca's Epistulae morales ad Lucilium
[@letters-to-lucilius], Book 2, Letter 13, Verse 16.

The original latin [@letters-to-lucilius-latin] for this appears to be:

```
Sed iam finem epistulae faciam, si illi signum suum in pressero, id est aliquam
magnificam vocem perferendam ad te mandavero. 'Inter cetera mala hoc quoque
habet stultitia: semper incipit vivere.' Considera quid vox ista significet,
Lucili virorum optime, et intelleges quam foeda sit hominum levitas cotidie
nova vitae fundamenta ponentium, novas spes etiam in exitu inchoantium.
```

## 3 - Step outside yourself

I try to view myself from a distance, or imagine that I am seeing myself as a
stranger would.

```{.email include=src/enchiridion/enchiridion.txt startLine=756 endLine=767}
```
[@enchiridion-gutenberg]

I literally try to imagine myself from outside of myself, and remind myself of
my small significance in relation to vastness of the cosmos, and the short
scale of time of any human life. This helps me to not take everyday things for
granted.

The other technique, to try and see myself and my own circumstances as a
stranger would is probably closer to Epictetus' original advice from the
Enchiridion.

In particular, when I catch myself bewailing something trivial, I like to
myself hearing Epictetus jokingly chide me "AlAs! HoW WreTchED Am I!" at my
imagined hardships.

Another quote that I particularly like is from the discourses of Epictetus:

```{.email include=src/epictetus-discourses/discourses.txt startLine=1379 endLine=1381}
```
[@epictetus-discourses-matheson-leg]

Though other translations [@epictetus-discourses] have it as:

> “What, then, must my leg be lame?”
> And is it for one paltry leg, wretch, that you accuse the universe?

[@epictetus-discourses-wretched-leg]

Original Greek source since I'm so obsessed with this quote:

> ‘σκέλος οὖν μοι γενέσθαι πεπηρωμένον.’
> ἀνδράποδον, εἶτα δι᾽ ἓν σκελύδριον τῷ κόσμῳ ἐγκαλεῖς;

| Ancient Greek | English |
|---------------|---------|
| μοι           | my |
| σκέλος        | leg     |
| οὖν           | then    |
| γενέσθαι      | become  |
| πεπηρωμένον   | lamed   |
| ἀνδράποδον    | lowlife / wretch / slave / one who acting slavishly |
| εἶτα δι᾽ ἓν   | then for one |
| σκελύδριον    | leg, diminuative form / paltry leg / poor leg |
| ἐγκαλεῖς      | (do you) accuse / blame |
| τῷ κόσμῳ      | the world / universe |
